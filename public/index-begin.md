rstudio::conf, the conference about all things R and RStudio, will take place January 13 and 14, 2017 in Orlando, Florida. The conference will feature talks and tutorials from popular RStudio data scientists and developers like Hadley Wickham, Yihui Xie, Joe Cheng, Winston Chang, Garrett Grolemund, and J.J. Allaire, along with lightning talks from RStudio partners and customers.

Preceding the conference, on January 11 and 12, RStudio will offer two days of optional training. Training attendees can choose from Hadley Wickhamâ€™s Master R training, a new Intermediate Shiny workshop from Shiny creator Joe Cheng or a new workshop from Garrett Grolemund that is based on his soon-to-be-published book with Hadley: Introduction to Data Science with R.
